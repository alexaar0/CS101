<h1>Homework #1 and now #2</h1>

<h3>Pledged: Reid Alexander</h3>
<hr>

<p>
My name is Reid Alexander; I am taking CS101.
</p>
<p>
On April 8th, 1997, I was born in Dallas, TX, which has served as my home for
 the past 18 years. I have one brother, Brooks, and my two parents, Diane and 
 David.
 <br>
 I am currently a freshman at 
 <span style="color:PURPLE"><b>Sewanee: The University of the South.</b></span> 
 Although I do not know what I want to major in, I will be playing on the golf 
 team alongside my studies.

 <h3 style="text-align:center">Next Five Years...</h3>
 <br>
<p>
In the next five years, graduating from 
<span style="color:PURPLE"><b>Sewanee: The University of the South.</b></span> 
is a goal of mine.  Economics and history currently have my interest. I have already accepted the fact that my major will change once, twice, or maybe more before I graduate. Before I committed to 
<span style="color:PURPLE"><b>Sewanee: The University of the South.</b></span> 
I had the intentions of majoring in business. Since then, I have seen how shallow of a major that is. Thankfully, regardless of what I major in, a degree from a liberal arts college is becoming more and more valuable. I plan on taking advantage of the business minor here. As of right now, I have little direction besides that. Maybe there might be a summer internship here and there or a semester abroad. The Carey Fellows program sounds interesting. I applied for that as an incoming freshman but was waitlisted. I plan on reapplying this year.  This could help me land an internship that was mentioned above.

<h3 style="text-align:center">What I have done to prepare...</h3>
<br>
<p>
In high school, I took man AP courses. These have gotten me used to a heavy workload, which I am finding out more and more that I will have a heavy one these next four years. According to those who have graduated from my high school, HPHS prepares kids well for college. I understand Sewanee has a heavier workload than others, but I feel I am prepared to adapt and tackle these future courses.

Junior year, one of the curses I took was AP Computer Science. In this course, we learned basic Java and were able to make a functioning pong game by the end of the year. After that, our focus changed to preparing for the AP exam. My computer science teacher has seen quite a few AP exams and said this was by far one of the hardest she has seen. I didn’t do so well ad made a three on this. The next year I made a five on AP Calculus AB and took the Oracle Academy course. This was unique and I’m glad I was able to take this. We learned the basics of SQL as well as the conceptual rules to set up a database. We were able to tie this into web pages with php. The second semester of this course we were preparing for the IBM DB2 Academic Associate exam. This was boring but it was worth it when it was all said and done. I'm glad to say I was one of the ones enrolled in the course that passed.
